# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
Poject Title: Coffee-Sales-Dashboard

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of Coffee Sales data using Microsoft Excel. The main objectives were to clean and transform the data, derive meaningful insights, and create an interactive dashboard to visualize the results.

Here are the key steps and techniques I utilized throughout the project:

Data Cleaning:

Imported the raw coffee sales data into Excel. Handled missing values by identifying and filling gaps or removing incomplete entries.

Used VLOOKUP to return values and coloums from another sheets to maintain consistency.

Standardized data formats to ensure consistency, such as date formats and text capitalization. And also grouped months into years categories.

Corrected any errors or anomalies in the dataset, such as duplicate entries and incorrect values.

Data Transformation:

Applied various Excel functions and formulas to transform the raw data into a more usable format.

Created calculated columns to derive new metrics, such as total sales, average sales per region, and growth rates. Aggregated the data to summarize sales by different dimensions, including time periods, regions, and product categories. Data Analysis:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and key insights. Used pivot tables to dynamically summarize and analyze the data.

Applied filters and slicers to segment the data for deeper analysis. Generated key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of different sales strategies.

Interactive Dashboard Creation:

Designed and developed an interactive dashboard using Excel's data visualization tools.

Incorporated charts, graphs, and pivot charts to present the data visually. Used slicers and pivot table interactions to allow users to filter and explore the data dynamically.

Created a user-friendly layout to ensure the dashboard is intuitive and easy to navigate. Outcome:

The project resulted in a detailed and interactive Excel dashboard that provides valuable insights into coffee sales performance. This dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by visualizing sales trends, identifying high-performing regions and products, and monitoring key sales metrics. The skills demonstrated in this project include data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and dashboard creation, all of which are crucial for effective data-driven decision-making in business.
